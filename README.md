# OCR-TRANSLATE-PROJECT

The OCR Translate Project is a small tool that aim to be lightweighted and easy to use.
It uses PyTesseract to do the OCR, as well as DeepL for the translation part.

Currently you have to manually setup the file location and run it through Visual Studio Code (or anything equivalent) as its still in the very early stage of developpement, but its working.

For DeepL, the main problem is that it require the API Key. You just have to create an account for free and you can have the key, but   since this tool is aiming for easy to use AND lightweight, its not gonna do it on the long run. I'll think of something else later.
